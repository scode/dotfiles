;; Bind certain frequently used operations to the top map, meaning
;; they can be used without use of the prefix key. More importantly,
;; because the super key is a modifier, they allow us to simply hold
;; the windows key pressed while invoking multiple commands. With the
;; normal prefix key we would have to re-press the prefix key between
;; every command.
