dotfiles (and similar) along with scripting to set up my personal
preferences.

If you use this and you're not me, audit all changes before using
them. No attempt at release engineering/backwards compatibility is
made.

Intended use is to run, from your home directory (with the path to
your checkout appropriately substituted):

  ./git/rcfiles/setup_env.py

It will set up symlinks to configuration files (and in the future,
possibly due addition things, if it isn't already and I just failed to
update the README to match).
