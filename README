Partially automates setting up my personally preferred environment in
*nix environments I am likely to encounter.

If you use this directly, audit all changes before using them. No
attempt at release engineering/backwards compatibility is made.

Intended use is to run, from your home directory (with the path to
your checkout appropriately substituted):

  ./git/rcfiles/setup_env.py

It will set up symlinks to configuration files (and in the future, or
now depending on whether I updated the config file in case of changes,
possibly other things).
